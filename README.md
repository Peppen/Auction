Each peer can sell and buy goods using a Second-Price Auctions (EBay). 
Second-price auction is a non-truthful auction mechanism for multiple items. 
Each bidder places a bid. The highest bidder gets the first slot, the second-highest, the second slot and so on, 
but the highest bidder pays the price bid by the second-highest bidder, the second-highest pays the price bid by the third-highest, and so on. 
The systems allows the users to create new auction (with an ending time, a reserved selling price and a description), 
check the status of an auction, and eventually place new bid for an auction.
